# 05 JavaScript: Day Planner

## Description:
This homework was to create a day planner for the hours of 9-5. You can type in a textarea and save the todo for each hour. The color of the text area also changes depending on the day.

This really tested my javascript and jQuery skills thus far. This really taught me how moment js works and (painfully) taught me that its output is stored as a string. It also gave me some new skills in working with jquery functions and html datasets.

It's frustrating that I could not figure out a more efficient way to store scores in javascript but it works for what it is.
